Full Stack Developer (Front and Backend) UI/UX design with experience in Python and CMS systems
I will be the first to admit at heart I am a Graphic Artist, with over 20 years in the field of design I enjoy the creative process. However, I also like to rei-invent myself, learning new processes and problem solving. This led me into the field of UI/UX design and then into web design and coding. Sure I like making things look pretty, but creating a working solution is really what great design is all about. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope I will be able to help you find the next solution to your problem and make it look amazing as well.
